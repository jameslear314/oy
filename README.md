# oy.

## wat?
eff your shoddy mobile carrier -- it carries nothing
eff your do-not-disturb settings -- you want to be disturbed
eff your email -- it shocks you little

eff all your communication settings when someone **else** needs to control how your phone responds

## y, tho?
consider your emergency contacts. if you really need their help when they can be helped, who can you reach?

when they desperately need you, are you there?

## uh, ok, so wat then does oy?
to all absolute extents of your device capabilities,
through all necessary means,
with all persistence,

oy will contact you until you respond.

when you aren't best served by your local emergency services and, but you need someone to yodel for you until someone's grandma's high-school sweetheart's third ex-partner knocks on your <3's door to tell that <3 you got needs,
task oy with that.

oy's got your back.

## huh. how, tho?
#### thing one
of those <3 you know, get both of you onto oy
#### thing two
to the extent you can support, link your contact details in oy
#### thing three
if you'd like more control, drag those details into an ordered graph to let oy know how to bother you
#### thing four
yo those <3 you want to be there for, using your threshold for how that <3 may bother you
#### thing five
accept or stash any offers you've got
#### thing six
maybe setup some widgets or whatnot to support yourself when you got needs
#### thing seven
go live your life

## yo -- wat when i got needs?
#### halp?
open your phone, stab a widget. oy takes it from there, and lets you know how well it connects to your <3
#### halp, that's not quite right
open your phone, open oy. stab a <3, or swipe that <3 as bothersomely as you need
#### halp, that's way too much
okay, cool -- drag that <3 back to the max level of bother you need right now
#### halp, oy can't reach that <3
we're sorry -- all we've got is electrons used to contact your human connections.
as always, we've got your local or cached emergency contacts in that !!?! down there in the bottom middle of the screen

# r u crazy?
We've considered, but we don't believe so. However -- we'd like this software to do good rather than harm, so let's cover your concerns (which you are welcome to submit via PR).

## Privacy
We only collect the data you give us and will delete any elements (or the whole shebang) when you ask us to. We'll use standard encryption libraries to the best of our abilities when we must store your details, and will offer ways for you to let Big Tech handle the root security of your use of oy.

*But.*
If you (collectively or via individual subscriptions) cover our costs, we'll offer a form of oy hosted on stuff with better guarantees than the always-free cloud offerings. See: [[link TBD]]

## Spam
By default, we use communication techniques which encourage local connections and use standard cryptographics to ensure new connections are legitimate and welcome. Remote connections are fine, but you'll need to explicitly enable that.

You have account details within oy, but we keep your info private to the best of our abilities.

## Stalking and intimate abuse
It does me pain that this is a topic we need to cover, but we do.

We can't make a system which completely resists abuse, criminal or otherwise -- and we regret that oy's offering can be used to do harm to others. oy was meant to be a service of distributed community support, not a weapon.

So.
### oy will be honest with you
To the extent we have data, we need to display it. However, we intentionally measure only success/failure for contact from the initiating oy app via an individual modality -- and your permission is one of those success tests you can control.
### We'll consider your feedback
PR, email, feedback widget within oy which secretly is an email... whatever -- as long as we're developing or supporting oy, we'd like to know what you think.
### You can control how oy reaches you
Adding (validated, with limits) and removing contact methods is up to you, as is how oy escalates through the ways it contacts you.
### You can control what you offer your connections
If your <3 is crossing your boundaries, we hope you can let them know. In all cases, you may drop permission for use of a contact method for one or more of your <3s. They'll know that contact mode is failing... but frankly, we thought of oy when our partner couldn't call us because our mobile provider wasn't initiating calls to our phone. We honestly can't predict if you (collectively) will use more limitations or encounter more systemic connection failures.
### in the end, oy is just an app
We'll miss you if you need to stop all communications or uninstall the app -- and we'll use failsafes so oy only contacts you if your device has connected or you've acknowledged in the past season that you're available for your <3s...

but oy is just an app, made by people who wanted to offer better support than they could otherwise. When you need to go, we'll support your needs in progressive ways, from contact nonpermission to contact detail archival to contact detail deletion to, eventually, retiring your account. We'll keep only a hash of any details we've removed in case you want to come back... or inform you prominently if the deletion you choose has permanent effects.

# but i don't believe u
It's true -- we have a leak or make a mistake (sorry! We're also not perfect :| ) or be compelled to disclose info, but we'll provide compulsion-resistant public communciation about how well we've met our goals. As many elements of oy as reasonable will be open source... for the specifically-educated to review, we guess.
You don't need to believe us on this, either -- but one of our number has lived longer than the doctors predicted they could, and they influence us constantly through a strong bias toward improving common welfare. We do the best we can; and right now, that is oy.
